"""
GraphQL schema that consists of several classes that are 
each associated with a particular Django model and one to 
specify how to resolve a few important types of queries 
youâ€™ll need in the front end.
Create a corresponding class for each of your models and 
the User model. 
They should each have a name that ends with Type because 
each one represents a GraphQL type.
Resolve a query by taking the information supplied in the 
query and returning the appropriate Django queryset in 
response.
The method for each resolver must start with resolve_, and 
the rest of the name should match the corresponding attribute.
